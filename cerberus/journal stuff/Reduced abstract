Web applications are constantly evolving to integrate new features and fix reported bugs
, but even imperceptible changes can sometimes entail significant modifications of the underlying structure of the web page.
Such continuous evolution of web applications make it extremely challenging to build scripts automating the interactions with the elements of a web page in a robust way (e.g., web test scripts, crawlers, or robotic process automation).
More precisely, the major cause of breakage in automation scripts are element locators, which are the identifiers used by automation scripts to navigate across the page.
When the page evolves, these identifiers tend to break, thus causing the related scripts to no longer locate the correct elements with which they need to interact.

For this reason, several contributions explored the idea of automatically generating or repairing locators on a page. 
Unfortunately, these approaches fail to scale when the complexity of web pages grows, often leading scripts to inaccurately relocate elements.
Our solution, named ERRATUM, adopts a holistic approach to reduce the element search space, which greatly eases the locator repair task and drastically improves repair accuracy.
The holistic approach is implemented using a carefully chosen tree matching algorithm applied to the locator repair problem.

We compare the robustness of ERRATUM on a large-scale benchmark composed of realistic and synthetic mutations applied to popular web applications currently deployed in production.
Our empirical results demonstrate that ERRATUM outperforms the accuracy of WATER, a state-of-the-art solution, by 67%.
