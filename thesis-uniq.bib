	abstract = {Starting from a denotational semantics of the eager untyped lambda-calculus with explicit runtime errors, the standard collecting semantics is deﬁned as specifying the strongest program properties. By a ﬁrst abstraction, a new sound type collecting semantics is derived in compositional ﬁxpoint form. Then by successive (semi-dual) Galois connection based abstractions, type systems and/or type inference algorithms are designed as abstract semantics or abstract interpreters approximating the type collecting semantics. This leads to a hierarchy of type systems, which is part of the lattice of abstract interpretations of the untyped lambda-calculus. This hierarchy includes two new `a la Church/Curry polytype systems. Abstractions of this polytype semantics lead to classical Milner/Mycroft and Damas/Milner polymorphic type schemes, Church/Curry monotypes and Hindley principal typing algorithm. This shows that types are abstract interpretations.},

@article{He2016,
abstract = {Anomaly detection plays an important role in management of modern large-scale distributed systems. Logs, which record system runtime information, are widely used for anomaly detection. Traditionally, developers (or operators) often inspect the logs manually with keyword search and rule matching. The increasing scale and complexity of modern systems, however, make the volume of logs explode, which renders the infeasibility of manual inspection. To reduce manual effort, many anomaly detection methods based on automated log analysis are proposed. However, developers may still have no idea which anomaly detection methods they should adopt, because there is a lack of a review and comparison among these anomaly detection methods. Moreover, even if developers decide to employ an anomaly detection method, re-implementation requires a non-trivial effort. To address these problems, we provide a detailed review and evaluation of six state-of-the-art log-based anomaly detection methods, including three supervised methods and three unsupervised methods, and also release an open-source toolkit allowing ease of reuse. These methods have been evaluated on two publicly-available production log datasets, with a total of 15,923,592 log messages and 365,298 anomaly instances. We believe that our work, with the evaluation results as well as the corresponding findings, can provide guidelines for adoption of these methods and provide references for future development.},
